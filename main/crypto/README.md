### Token Contract Addresses

> Each token holds a specific contract address for importing that token into your crypto wallet. For proper import, it is recommended to use **MetaMask**. If you don’t have MetaMask, consider using a wallet connected to the Ethereum Mainnet.

### **Additional Note on Token Distribution Accounts**


The **Management Server** utilizes **three different types of accounts** to ensure a safe, flexible, and organized distribution of tokens. These accounts have specific functions that contribute to the streamlined management and allocation of tokens.

---

### 1. **Distribution Account**  
The **Distribution Account** is responsible for storing all essential and taxed tokens. Its primary function is to manage the bulk distribution of tokens to the **Root Account** as required, ensuring efficient and organized token flow within the system.

---

### 2. **Service Account**  
The **Service Account** performs several critical functions:
- **Storage of Tokens**: It holds tokens generated from various service-related activities.
- **Tax Management**: The account may also receive **taxes** from taxed tokens, facilitating proper tax handling and allocation.

This account plays an essential role in tracking and managing tokens related to specific services while also providing flexibility in handling tax-related transactions.

---

### 3. **Pool Account**  (Moved to Service Account)
The **Pool Account** is primarily designed to collect various fees, such as liquidity and marketing fees, particularly for **Specialized (SP)** tokens. It helps separate these fees from other operational funds, offering better organization and transparency within the ERC-20 token ecosystem. 

Key roles of the **Pool Account**:
- **Fee Collection**: It gathers liquidity and marketing fees, ensuring clear differentiation from other project accounts.
- **Donations**: The account is also used to receive donations, supporting community engagement or additional funding.
- **Financial Transparency**: By isolating specific fees and donations, it provides better oversight and management of the project's finances.

---

### 4. **Root Account** *(Owner's Private Account)*  
The **Root Account** is the most important account within the system, owned solely by the **project's creator**. It functions as the central hub for all token-related activities and holds significant authority over the system's operations. Key responsibilities of the **Root Account** include:
- **Tax Collection**: It receives the majority of transaction taxes from taxed tokens and other associated revenue streams.
- **Foundation for Other Accounts**: The Root Account oversees and controls the **Distribution** and **Service Accounts**, ensuring seamless coordination and management of token operations. Reserved exclusively for the project's owner, the **Root Account** is fundamental to maintaining control and structure within the ecosystem.
