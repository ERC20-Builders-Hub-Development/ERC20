# 💼 Crypto Contracts – Wealth Storage & Verification Protocol

Welcome to the **Crypto Contracts Suite** – a premium selection of blockchain-based digital contracts designed to represent **stored wealth**, **identity integrity**, and **proof-of-ownership** in a decentralized ecosystem.

These contracts are **purchaseable**, **tradable**, and **verifiably owned** on-chain, making them ideal as both **crypto assets** and **prestige-bearing digital certificates**.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

Each contract serves one or more of the following goals:

- 💰 **Store high-value wealth** visibly and securely on-chain  
- 💹 **Demonstrate digital credibility or status**
- 🔁 **Sell or transfer to other users as a verifiable high-end asset**
- 🧾 **Create traceable and auditable financial movements**

> ✅ When a contract is **sold**, both sender and receiver **share the transaction investment**—meaning **the final value is negotiated**, allowing mutual proof of involvement.

## 🛒 Contract Ownership & Trading Rules

1. **Ownership** of a contract gives you full on-chain control and display rights.
2. **Selling** a contract requires a **mutual agreement on the price**:
   - Part of the value is retained on both ends as a form of cryptographic proof of wealth exchange.
3. Contracts are **non-fungible** and **unique** – each one is a tokenized record of presence and financial signal in the ecosystem.
4. All contracts below are pending **address assignment** and will be minted via verified channels.
